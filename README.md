# Fries

This is a project based on a simple character called 'Fry'. I came up with it during a lesson at school

and after a few weeks i coded the generator of Fries in python. The program generates files in SVG, PNG and PDF, but i also created one (using crochet hook) waistcoat with Fry on the back:

## Start the generator

1) To start the generator you need to install python3
2) open generator.py
3) to the input you should give two values:
- size of output image
- name of final folder
4) wait a few seconds and you have your unique character
